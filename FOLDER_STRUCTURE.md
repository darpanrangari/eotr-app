### Key Components:

-   **node_modules/**: Libraries and modules your project depends on, installed via npm or yarn. Typically not checked into version control.
-   **src/**: This is where your source code lives. It's broken down into several subdirectories:
    -   **api/**: Contains controllers, routes, and services. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to services for business logic. Routes define URIs and their corresponding controllers. Services contain business logic.
    -   **config/**: Stores configuration files and environment variables.
    -   **models/**: Defines schemas for your data models, usually for a database.
    -   **middleware/**: Functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
    -   **utilities/**: Helper functions and utilities shared across your application.
-   **tests/**: Contains your automated tests. Could be further organized by test type (unit, integration, etc.).
-   **public/**: For static assets like images, CSS, JavaScript files, accessible directly.
-   **views/**: For template files if you are doing server-side rendering using templating engines like EJS, Pug, etc.
-   **.env**: A file for environment-specific variables that should not be committed to version control for security reasons.
-   **.gitignore**: Specifies files that should not be committed to your version control.
-   **package.json & package-lock.json/yarn.lock**: Lists all project dependencies and their specific versions, ensuring that the project is consistent across all development and production environments.
